== NonBlank PLUGIN for DokuWiki ==

When writing documents in markup languages which preserve a single link break in CJK,
an unexpected space might be inserted between two full-width characters,
which is not the common usage in CJK.
Moreover, those spaces might disturb the search of phrases or sentences.
Therefore it would be better those spaces being removed.
